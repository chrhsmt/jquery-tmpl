## This repository was the home of the jQuery Templates plugin, and is no longer active.

The jQuery Templates plugin (here and at [github.com/nje/jquery-tmpl](https://github.com/nje/jquery-tmpl)) was adopted by the jQuery team as an official plugin, and migrated to [http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl). It is now owned by jQuery UI, who have decided to discontinue development. 

**_Note_: Ongoing work on jQuery Templates (next-generation) is continuing at [JsRender](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender) and [JsViews](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews).**

**See [this blog post](http://www.borismoore.com/2011/10/jquery-templates-and-jsviews-roadmap.html) for more context on the roadmap for jQuery Templates, JsRender and JsViews...**
